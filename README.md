## Mobile Robots 
The Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are a combination of phyisical systems which 
perform some kind of process or function, and the digital twins that model 
their behavior. During college I work on disciplines such as precision 
design, artificial intelligence, advanced control, robotics, additive 
manufacturing and advanced computational modeling. This repository contains 
the algorithms used to developed different Mobile Robots. 


### Projects
The projects I developed during college were:
* Maze Mapping using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot (OMR)
    * Using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot developed navigation algorithms so that
      the robot would be able to avoid obstacles across a Maze until it finds a specific
      target. For this project those targets were 3 soda cans. Once the robot found them,
      it would use its robotic arm to reach for one of those cans and take it back to the
      starting position.

* Control over 2 Omnidirectional Mobile Robots (OMR)
    * Using a camera's range vision as a X and Y plane, control the movement of two OMR
      by giving a Lider Vritual Robot the coordinates I wanted them to visit. Both Robots
      would respect each other space and act as magnets whenever they were to close or to
      separate one from the other.
      
*  Path Follower and Object Identification Differential Mobile Robot
   *  Using the Differential Mobile Robot's camera, it was able to detect the path generated
      with the black tape and also the different traffic signs that were introduced at the map.
      For these I needed to know the Differential Mobile Robot's kinematics.

### Differential Mobile Robot (DMR)
This type of mobile robot uses two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot's body. This type of configuration allows the robot to change directions without the need of an additional steering mechanism.
